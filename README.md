# yt2nus3audio
Enter a yt link and convert it into a nus3audio, idsp, or brstm file!

## Notice
This is the batch file version of the program but uses python for certain features. It is recommended to use the python version instead.

### Un-pythoning the batch file
To avoid using python, delete the line that removes special characters (this may become a problem for videos with special characters in the title) and don't use the automatic loop point calculation feature
